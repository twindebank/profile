      Put your hands up if you haven’t heard of the BBC! None of you? Thought so…
      Not only will this talk give you an
      insight into the unique challenges and opportunities alike the BBC faces with
      data, but you will also gain an
      entry-level understanding Semantic Web technologies, and how concepts such as
      knowledge graphs can provide
      powerful ways to analyse and emphasise relationships in data.
