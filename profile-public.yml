    achievements:
      - >
        Awarded the Gibb's prize for best third year team project. Designed hardware, a distributed computing facility,
        and set of computational processes that make it possible to scan, process, upload, and save an entire human brain
        for possible future reanimation. This fine-tuned my team working skills and has broadened my data analysis
        skill-set.
      - >
        Co-authored a paper relating to the findings of my fourth year project, `Mosquito Detection with Neural Networks:
        The Buzz of Deep Learning'.

          Building a microservice-based infrastructure, designed to ingest and relate content from across the BBC into a

          Growth of knowledge beyond code is facilitated through exposure to the product growing from concept to reality;
          for example, how internal/external communications are handled, how roadmaps are developed and are dynamic, how to
          deal with constantly changing requirements, and how to make decisions in unfamiliar environments.

          Talking at PyData London 2018 about some of the technologies the team are working with proved an invaluable
          experience, which, among other things, emphasised to me the importance of the communities that surround the open
          source tools we use daily.

          Experience, understanding, and general awareness of the many tools and platforms used in a context such as this
          have increased dramatically.

        Put your hands up if you haven’t heard of the BBC! None of you? Thought so… Not only will this talk give you an
        insight into the unique challenges and opportunities alike the BBC faces with data, but you will also gain an
        entry-level understanding Semantic Web technologies, and how concepts such as knowledge graphs can provide
        powerful ways to analyse and emphasise relationships in data.
