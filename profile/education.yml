    achievements:
      - >
        Awarded the Gibb's prize for best third year team project. Designed hardware, a distributed computing facility,
        and set of computational processes that make it possible to scan, process, upload, and save an entire human brain
        for possible future reanimation. This fine-tuned my team working skills and has broadened my data analysis
        skill-set.
