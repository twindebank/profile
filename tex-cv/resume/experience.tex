             \item{Building a microservice-based infrastructure, designed to ingest and relate content from across the BBC into a single place.}
             \item{Growth of knowledge beyond code is facilitated through exposure to the product growing from concept to reality; for example, how internal/external communications are handled, how roadmaps are developed and are dynamic, how to deal with constantly changing requirements, and how to make decisions in unfamiliar environments.}
             \item{Talking at PyData London 2018 about some of the technologies the team are working with proved an invaluable experience, which, among other things, emphasised to me the importance of the communities that surround the open source tools we use daily.}
